# House Prices Prediction using Linear Regression

Thrilled to highlight a pivotal role in my journey as a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy Infotech! My primary focus revolved around the creation of a robust logistic regression model designed to predict house prices, leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 14,000 rows and an expansive 80+ features.

Embarking on this project involved a meticulous process, commencing with in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to comprehend the intricate patterns within the dataset. Subsequently, I dedicated substantial effort to feature engineering, a critical step in enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. The complexity of the dataset necessitated strategic feature scaling to ensure optimal model performance, a facet I approached with precision.

One noteworthy challenge surfaced in handling skewed continuous data, prompting the application of logarithmic transformations. This nuanced step proved instrumental in aligning the data distribution, contributing significantly to the model's accuracy and overall effectiveness.

Furthermore, the dataset presented a notable prevalence of outliers, demanding a methodical approach to their management. Addressing these outliers was pivotal to refining the model's robustness, and I undertook systematic measures to mitigate their impact, ensuring the model's resilience against potential distortions.

In essence, this experience not only honed my technical acumen but also underscored the importance of a holistic approach to machine learning projects. Excited to share these insights and more as I continue to navigate the dynamic landscape of machine learning as an intern at Prodigy Infotech!
